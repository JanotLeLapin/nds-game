# NDS Game

A cool NDS Game

## ðŸ“„ About

I don't really know what I'm doing but this is a little game for Nintendo DS made using libnds.

## ðŸ“¦ Build from source

If you want to build the game from source, you'll need to setup [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)\
Then run these commands to clone the repo and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanotLeLapin/nds-game
cd nds-game
make
```
